This is a Patchlunky mod template that contains the necessary directory structure 
for modding strings, music, sounds and textures.

Make sure the folder of this mod template is inside the Patchlunky Mods directory,
so that Patchlunky can find it.


Use the "MOD-UTIL: Extract default archives" in patchlunky Settings menu to extract
the default .WAD resources into "Patchlunky\Patchlunky_Temp\alltex" and 
"Patchlunky\Patchlunky_Temp\allsounds" directories.

Copy any file that you wish to modify from these two folders to the matching folder
within the mod template.

Once you are done modifying the files, you can select this mod template in the 
Patchlunky Mods tab, and patch the game. If you dont see the mod template, try
restarting Patchlunky to refresh the list of mods.

Good luck!
